# Day 3: Familiarize with the Repository Structure

## Beginner
- Browse the Table of Contents in the System Design Primer and open at least three sections that interest you.
- Note the main categories covered, such as databases or caching.

## Intermediate
- Explore the folder layout in the repo, paying attention to the `solutions/` directory and how it maps to topics in the README.
- Map README sections to the corresponding folders.

## Advanced
- Clone the repository locally and inspect how examples and documentation are organized.
- Identify any missing topics or areas for improvement and consider opening an issue or PR.

## Resources

## Project Ideas

- Draft a small improvement proposal for the README or documentation.
